# College Student Interview Survey ‚Äî Proof of Concept

## Overview

This project is a **proof of concept (PoC)** for an interactive platform that visualizes and explores qualitative interview data from college students.
It demonstrates an **end-to-end search and clustering experience** built from structured JSON analysis outputs.

The pipeline consists of:

1. **Upstream LLM Analysis (external)** ‚Äî An external process generates structured JSON documents (summaries, themes, quotes, timelines, etc.) from transcripts.
2. **Embedding Enrichment (this repo)** ‚Äî This repository ingests those LLM-generated JSONs, applies text embeddings via `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, and prepares them for visualization.
3. **Static Site Build (this repo)** ‚Äî A React-based static website (published to GitHub Pages) demonstrates:

   * Full-text and semantic search
   * Cluster analysis of interview embeddings
   * Interactive exploration of interviews, summaries, and themes

## 1.1 Transcript Ingestion (External)

> **Note:** Transcript ingestion and LLM analysis occur outside this repository.
> This repo assumes that fully analyzed JSON documents are provided **without embeddings**.

### Expected Upstream Output

Each JSON file should conform to the schema described below, containing:

* Interview metadata (IDs, format, demographics)
* LLM-generated summaries, themes, quotes, and improvement areas
* Empty `embedding` arrays (to be populated here)

All `embedding` fields are expected to be **empty arrays** in the upstream data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 1.6 Data Ingestion and Validation (This Repo)

### 1.6.3 Data Ingestion and Validation

#### 1.6.3.1 JSON Collection

* On build, the **embedding generator** scans for JSON files in `/data/interviews/`.
* Only **modified or new** files (since last successful build) are reprocessed.
* First-time runs process all JSONs.

#### 1.6.3.2 Schema Validation

* Each JSON is validated against the current schema version.
* Results appear in the build UI:

  * ‚úÖ **Valid files** ‚Äî green checkmark with count
  * ‚ö†Ô∏è **Schema warnings** ‚Äî yellow icon, partial rendering possible
  * ‚ùå **Critical errors** ‚Äî red icon, blocks build

#### 1.6.3.3 Embedding Generation

* For each valid JSON, the following text fields are embedded using [`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2):

  * Summaries
  * Themes
  * Timeline points
  * Quotes
  * Areas for improvement
* Generated embeddings are inserted back into the JSON and cached in a local build directory.

---

### 1.6.4 Search Index Generation

#### 1.6.4.1 Vector Database Build

* Uses **FAISS (WebAssembly build)** for client-side vector similarity search.
* Supports:

  * Semantic search across all summaries, themes, quotes, and timelines
  * Filtering by metadata (year, demographics, theme category)
  * Configurable similarity threshold
* Serialized index is stored for fast static loading.

#### 1.6.4.2 Full-Text Search Index

* Built using **Lunr.js** for lightweight keyword-based search.
* Includes all text fields except full transcripts.
* **d3.js** powers visualizations and cluster diagrams.

---

## üí° Static Site Generator

* React-based static site (built via Vite).
* Deployment target: **GitHub Pages**.
* **Main Page**: Cluster analysis visualization showing all interviews as nodes.

  * Hovering highlights interviews and related entities (summaries, themes, etc.)
  * Clicking opens the **rendered JSON object** view for that interview.
* Demonstrates:

  * Semantic grouping of similar interview experiences
  * Cross-linking between themes and quotes
  * Validation and data provenance visualization
